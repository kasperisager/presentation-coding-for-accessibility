  <h2>Mindset</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Key point</h4>
  <p>Coding for accessibility is not only about coding for people with disabilities.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It's just as much about coding for people without.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Take me for example: I <em>really</em> don't like using a mouse.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In fact, chances are that most of you don't either.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>As developers, we spend most of our time manipulating text.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If we can accomplish a task with a keyboard, we likely prefer doing so.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>By making sure you code with accessibility in mind, <em>every</em> user of your application will benefit.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If you can do a thing with a mouse–<strong>whatever it may be</strong>–you must also be able to do the thing with a keyboard.</p>
  <p class="fragment"><em>No excuses!</em> <span class="fragment"><strong>Seriously.</strong></span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Don't</h4>
  {{ fiddle('mcqr1gau') }}
  <p><small>The above will only react to mouse interaction, <em>not</em> keyboard interaction.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Do</h4>
  {{ fiddle('xyebkd1p', css=true) }}
  <p><small>The above will react to mouse <em>and</em> keyboard interaction.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Don't</h4>
  {{ fiddle('zm49gst8', css=true) }}
  <p><small>Buttons now only react visually to mouse interaction and not keyboard interaction.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Do</h4>
  {{ fiddle('jsrqrekz', css=true) }}
  <p><small>As a rule of thumb make sure that <code>focus</code> appears alongside <code>hover</code>.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If you have an <strong>implicit</strong> relation between elements of your UI, make that relation <strong>explicit</strong>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Don't</h4>
  {{ fiddle('vonwmzaL', js=true) }}
  <p><small>Sighted users will be able to infer the relation between the button and the thing it toggles, but users who rely on screen readers will not.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Do</h4>
  {{ fiddle('ueaje3Ld', js=true) }}
  <p><small>By making the relation between the button and the thing it toggles explicit, screen readers will now play along as well.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>In conclusion</h4>
  <p>Make a habit of <em>not</em> assuming how people will interact with your UI. <strong>Leave all doors open!</strong></p>
