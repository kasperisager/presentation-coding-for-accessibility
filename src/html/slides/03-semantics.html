  <h2>Semantics</h2>
  <p class="fragment"><em>What is that even?</em> <span class="fragment">Exactly!</span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>When we walk about <strong>semantics</strong>, we're really interested in answering the question <em>"what is the thing?"</em> and not <em>"what does the thing look like?"</em></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>By answering the second question, you can typically be sure that an answer to the first question will appear as well. <strong class="fragment">Herein lies the problem!</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Users without sight will not be able to answer the second question, leaving it up to their screen reader to attempt to answer the first question.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The only way a screen reader can provide an answer is if you–the person coding the thing we're questioning–made it explicit <em>what the thing is</em>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>What to do?</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Use semantic markup</p>
  <p class="fragment"><em>or</em></p>
  <p class="fragment">Add semantic hints</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Let's make a table!</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>With semantic markup</h4>
  {{ fiddle('g6r6kayz/1') }}
  <p class="fragment"><small>Native tables are really hard to work with though. Have you ever tried creating overlapping cell borders for example? <span class="fragment"><em>It's actually impossible!</em></span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>With custom markup</h4>
  {{ fiddle('746cLr2b/1') }}
  <p class="fragment"><small>Much better! Tables based on divs and flexbox are a lot easier to style and we're free to do it however we want.</small></p>
  <p class="fragment"><small>There's one problem though... <em class="fragment">Screen reader support!</em></small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>With semantic hints</h4>
  {{ fiddle('jmdmqyn8/2') }}
  <p class="fragment"><small>Now we have markup and styling freedom <em>and</em> screen readers play along as well. Yay!</small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Beware!</h4>
  <h3>Looks can deceive</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>What <em>is</em> this?</h3>
  {{ fiddle('5qvhx6ja') }}
  <p class="fragment"><small>If you're thinking that the toggle should be a button then I definitely agree with you.<br><span class="fragment">But is it so?</span></small></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Another rule of thumb</h4>
  <p class="fragment">Buttons <em>should never</em> move focus away from the thing being interacted with.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Links <em>should always</em> move focus away from it.</p>

  <p>...and please don't <strong>ever</strong> write <code>href="#"</code>.</p>
