  <p class="fragment"><em>What is that?</em> <span class="fragment">Exactly!</span></p>

<section>
  <p>When we walk about <strong>semantics</strong>, we're really interesting is answering the question <em>"what is the thing?"</em> and not <em>"what does the thing look like?"</em></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>By answering the second question, you can typically be sure that an answer to the first question will appear as well. <strong class="fragment">Herein lies the problem!</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Users without sight will not be able to answer the second question, leaving it up to their screen reader to attempt to answer the first question.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The only way a screen reader can provide an answer is if you–the person coding the thing we're questioning–made it explicit <em>what the thing is</em>.</p>

  <h3>What to do?</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Use semantic markup</p>
  <p class="fragment"><em>or</em></p>
  <p class="fragment">Add semantic hints</p>

  <h4>Beware!</h4>
  <h3>Looks can deceive</h3>
